# Zack's Powershell Scripts
This is a collection of Powershell scripts I wrote while working in the computer lab at University of Hawaii's TIM Computer Lab.

## Things to Note
Some of these scripts are accompanied with a batch file. This is just a shortcut to run the script as admin (with a login, of course) by double clicking the batch file.

All Active Directory information and information regarding TIM's IT department has been redacted.

Information about what each script does is written on the first 1-3 lines as a comment.
